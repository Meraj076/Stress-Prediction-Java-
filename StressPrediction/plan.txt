PROJECT PLAN & DEVELOPMENT LOG (StressOMeter)

================================================================================
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================
Goal: Build a Stress Prediction Web Application.
Core Value: Analyze user lifestyle data to predict stress levels and suggest coping mechanisms.
Tech Stack: Java (Spring Boot) Backend + HTML/CSS/JS Frontend.

================================================================================
2. DEVELOPMENT PHASES
================================================================================

PHASE 1: INITIAL SETUP & PROTOTYPING (Completed)
------------------------------------------------
- [x] Set up Spring Boot project with Maven.
- [x] Create basic directory structure (Controller, Service, Templates).
- [x] Implement basic Login and Dashboard views.
- [x] Establish "Prediction Engine" (logic-based simulation).

PHASE 2: UI/UX OVERHAUL (Completed)
-----------------------------------
- [x] Design "Space Theme" aesthetic (Deep Purple/Blue gradients).
- [x] Implement Glassmorphism for cards and sidebars.
- [x] Create dedicated Landing Page (`main1.html`) to explain the product.
- [x] Ensure Mobile Responsiveness (Media Queries, Hamburger Menus).

PHASE 3: FLOW REFINEMENT (Completed)
------------------------------------
- [x] Move Landing Page to Root (`/`).
- [x] Integrate Auth Buttons (Sign Up/Login) correctly into the Landing Page header.
- [x] Remove "Guest" access to encourage data tracking.
- [x] Fix "Sign Up" flow to auto-login users (UX Friction reduction).

PHASE 4: FEATURE EXPANSION (In Progress/Next)
---------------------------------------------
- [x] Add "Coping Strategies" module based on Root Cause.
- [ ] (Future) Integrate real Machine Learning model (Python/Flask microservice).
- [ ] (Future) Add "Community" features for shared support.
- [ ] (Future) Email notifications for high-stress alerts.

================================================================================
3. DECISION LOG
================================================================================
[2026-01-08] Refined Landing Page Header:
    - Problem: Mobile menu was cluttered, button visibility was poor.
    - Solution: Moved "Sign Up" button INSIDE `nav` for mobile. Forced white text.
    - Result: Cleaner mobile UI.

[2026-01-07] Auth Flow change:
    - Problem: Users had to log in again immediately after signing up.
    - Solution: Implemented auto-login logic in `UserService`.

[2026-01-05] Terminology Shift:
    - Request: User wanted to remove "AI/ML" buzzwords.
    - Action: Renamed to "Computational Model", "Advanced Analysis".

================================================================================
4. ARCHITECTURE NOTES
================================================================================
- The "Prediction" is currently stateless (calculated on the fly). 
- History is stored in a temporary H2 database for the session.
- Frontend uses Vanilla JS to keep it lightweight (`dashboard.js`).

================================================================================
5. HOW TO MAINTAIN
================================================================================
- To update the Landing Page: Edit `src/main/resources/templates/main1.html`.
- To tweak Prediction Logic: Edit `src/main/java/.../service/PredictionService.java`.
- To change Colors: Update `:root` variables in the `<style>` block of HTML files.
